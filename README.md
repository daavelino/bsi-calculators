Risk and impact calculators to support BSI IT-Grundschutz management activities

Disclaimer:
1. These 2 scripts are PROTOTYPES only. It is completely functional but it is in the prototype phase.
2. This project is completely independent from BSI. 

Call for improvements:
The code here could be improved to reach easy maintainence.
Some refinements suggestion are:

1. generate the entire HTML code (or most of it) via Javascript.
2. improve the layout (CSS) for better visualization.
